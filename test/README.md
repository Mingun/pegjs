# PEG.js Test Suites

This directory contains various test suites and scripts to ensure PEG.js works correctly.

* [Spec Suite](spec): Runs various test's that ensure PEG.js and it's generated parsers are working as intended. All tests should always pass on all supported platforms.
* [Benchmark Suite](benchmark): It measures speed of the parsers generated by PEG.js on various inputs. Its main goal is to provide data for code generator optimizations.
* [Impact Script](impact): Measures impact of a Git commit (or multiple commits) on generated parsers speed and size.

## Download and Install

## Running in Node.js

The commands below need to be executed via the console from the PEG.js root directory (one level up from this one), after which they will output their results (if any).

  * Execute source code linting:

     ```console
     $ gulp lint
     ```

  * Execute the spec test suite:

     ```console
     $ gulp test
     ```

  * Execute the benchmark suite:

     ```console
     $ gulp benchmark
     ```

  * Execute the impact suite:

     ```console
     $ node test/impact
     ```

## Running in the Browser

  1. Serve the test suites using a web server:

     ```console
     $ node test/server/run
     ```

  2. Point your browser to the [test suite](http://localhost:8000/)
